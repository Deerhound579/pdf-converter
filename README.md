Start learning Haskell

I wrote this converter to generate a PDF of lecture notes from [CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/), so it's possible to read it on my e-reader.

This semester, the language used in my CS course is OCaml. Most of my time, I'll focus on OCaml, but I'll come back to Haskell after this course.
